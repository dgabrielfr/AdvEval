Do not mix AWT / Swing with SwingStates

Use tags => 
    e.addTag(bla);
    e.removeShapes(bla);
    
CEllipse ce = canvas.newEllipse(x, y, w, h);
ce.setFillPaint(color.Red);
ce.addTag(yollo);


Apparatus:
remember to put the PC type (proc, screen..), java version, mouse.  Put ALL relevent details

Hypothesis:
H1: VV1 is preattentive
H2: VV2 is preattentive
H3: VV1VV2 is preattentive

XP
within subject design
two factors: VV and objects count

-> two way repeated Anova with factors VisualVariable and ObjectsCount on time

    VV1  VV2 VV1VV2
6
9
16

DO IT (MF!!) -> interpretation || faster || /!\ Cannot tell preattentive or not
So post-hoc too

preattentive -> linear regression
a + bx

Learning effect? -> graph

Can also make one way Anova for ObjectsCount

/!\ Remove the pratice /!\

Screenshots of VisualVariables !! (gif ???)
